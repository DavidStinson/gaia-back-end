# Objectives

In this task you will use the following information to develop the content for the microlesson: {microlessonTitle}.

This microlesson is a part of the module: {title}.
The module is about: {about}.

The microlesson metadata is as follows:
- Title: {microlessonTitle}
- Time: {microlessonTime}
- Learning Objective: {microlessonLearningObjective}
- Outline: {microlessonOutline}
- Learner Persona: {learnerPersona}
- Tools: {tools}

Leveraging your deep expertise in this topic, take the provided module metadata (generated by the instructional architect) as your primary input. Your core task is to develop comprehensive, accurate, and engaging content for the microlesson. Ensure all generated content is technically accurate for the module topic, maintains an engaging tone, and is appropriately paced and scaffolded for the specified learner persona.

You must:

## Expand the microlesson outline so that it can be used to teach students in a virtual classroom setting 

- Provide clear, detailed explanations of the key concepts outlined for that microlesson. 
- Break down complex ideas into digestible parts directly targeted at the learner persona. 
- Include relevant examples or analogies to illustrate the concepts effectively.
- Include code snippets (if applicable to the module topic - for example, if the module is teaching programming, then code snippets are appropriate).
- Microlessons in modules should generally build off of one another, and so the content for each microlesson should be written in a way that is consistent with the content of the previous microlessons. 
- Ensure headings are used to break up the content into logical sections. Headings should be a brief and concise. Headings h2-h4 should be written in sentence case. h5 headings and below should never be used. Each outline point will generally indicate an h2 heading, but you should use your best judgement to break up the content into logical sections. The text from the outline points should generally not be used as a heading, but rather as a starting point for the content that should be written under a given heading.

### Additionally, you should adhere to these guidelines of things you should not do

- Never use any horizontal rules \`---\` to separate sections of the content.
- Never include any multiple choice questions or knowledge checks.
- Never close the microlesson with a reflection on your work.
- Never close the microlesson with a congratulatory message.
- Never close the microlesson with next steps.
- Never close each microlesson with a recap of the key concepts learned in the microlesson.

## Create a detailed activity

- Each microlesson should have an activity of some kind. This could be one of many types of activities including:
  - Solo exercise
  - Partner exercise
  - Group exercise
  - Discussion
  - Pair programming
  - Mob programming
- The activity should never be multiple choice questions or knowledge checks.
- Transform the preliminary activity idea into a fully realized, step-by-step interactive exercise.
- Ensure the activity directly supports the specific learning objective of the microlesson and contributes to the overall learning objectives of the microlesson.

## Take into account the previous microlessons in the module as you develop this microlesson

Below is the content from the previous microlessons. Ensure that the content from the previous microlessons is taken into account as you develop the content for this microlesson, as they are generally intended to build upon one another:

<microlessons_text>
{smePreviousMicrolessonContent}
</microlessons_text>

## Expected output

A detailed Markdown document (do not fence off the content with \`\`\`markdown or any other delimiters) containing the fully developed content for the microlesson. 

The output document should meticulously follow the content of the input outline, replacing the initial brief descriptions with comprehensive, ready-to-use content.

The output must include:

- The title of the microlesson formatted as: # {title}
- The learning objective of the microlesson formatted as: **Learning Objective:** {microlessonLearningObjective}
- Clear, paragraph-based explanations of each concept pertinent to the microlesson objective. Subheadings should be used to break up the content into logical sections and should be named appropriately in sentence case.
- Formatted examples (for example, code snippets if the module topic is technical, practical scenarios, visual descriptions if applicable).
- Explanations tailored to the learner persona and follow the best practices from our internal documentation found in the Context section.
- Ensure that the document is well-structured (for example, blank lines should be used to separate markdown elements like paragraphs, headings, lists, code blocks, callouts, etc.)
- Activities should follow these guidelines:
  - Numbered, step-by-step instructions for the hands-on task or interactive element.
  - Activities should not use any tools that are not included in the tools list.
  - A refined and thought-provoking discussion prompt related to the activity and relevant to the learner persona.

The final markdown output must represent complete, accurate, and engaging instructional content for the core microlesson sections, fully aligned with the module topic, learner persona, and learning objectives.

<task>
You must:

## Weave in real-world examples, practical application, or analogies if appropriate

Identify key concepts and explore opportunities to introduce real-world examples or analogies that resonate with the learner persona's background. These narratives should serve to illustrate complex ideas in an accessible and memorable way, as guided by the documentation provided in the Context section below to ensure the content is written in a modular way utilizing the practices we use to write technical content (if the subject matter is technical).

## Create connections through relatability and build on previous content 

Analyze the technical content for potential points of confusion or abstraction. Develop relatable examples or analogies that bridge the gap between the abstract and the concrete, helping learners grasp the underlying principles. Refer to the documentation provided in the Context section below for guidance on building effective and understandable examples.

## Strategically incorporate interaction

Review the existing activity and identify natural points to embed meaningful interactions and knowledge checks (discussion prompts, chat questions). Ensure these interactions are purposeful, reinforce the learning objectives, and cater to the learner persona's engagement style.

## Optimize for practical application

Consider how the existing theoretical content can be directly connected to practical application and real-world problem-solving. Suggest ways to modify activities or add mini-challenges that allow learners to apply their knowledge in realistic scenarios, potentially leveraging the capabilities of the tools used in the microlesson as described in the Context section below for guidance on building effective and understandable examples for technical topics.

## Maintain learning focus

Ensure that all added narrative elements, relatable moments, and interactive opportunities directly support the learning objectives of the microlesson and contribute to a deeper understanding of the core concepts. Never add elements that are purely for entertainment and do not serve a pedagogical purpose.

## Format for clarity and connection

Ensure the final output adheres to the formatting guidelines in our documentation found below, making the content visually appealing and easy to follow. Use formatting to highlight relatable examples and key takeaways.

As you're writing markdown, ensure you're leaving a blank space between each different markdown element (e.g. between paragraphs, between headings, between lists, between code blocks, etc.).

## Craft globally relevant content

Ensure that the content is relevant to a global audience. Avoid using american-centric examples or references that may not resonate with learners from different cultural backgrounds. Use examples that are universally relatable and applicable to a diverse audience. Refrain from using idioms or colloquial expressions that may not translate well across cultures. Use the documentation found in the Context section below for guidance on writing globally relevant content.
